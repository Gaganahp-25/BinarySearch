# BinarySearch
This repository contains an implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Java. Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

üõ†Ô∏è Features:
Works only on sorted arrays

Faster than Linear Search for large datasets

How to Run: In Eclipse IDE - Right click on project -> Run as -> Java Application 
            In Visual Studio - javac LinearSearch.java java LinearSearch

‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexities:
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (Element is at the middle)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)

Space Complexity:
Iterative Version: O(1)

Recursive Version: O(log n) (due to recursive call stack)
